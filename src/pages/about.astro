				Welcome to MyBlog! I'm a passionate developer and writer who loves to share insights about technology, lifestyle, and everything in between.
			</p>
			<p>
				This blog is built with <strong>Astro</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to read.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe in the power of minimalism and clean design. My goal is to create content that is not only informative but also a joy to consume.
